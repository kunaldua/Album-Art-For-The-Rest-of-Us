Album-Art-For-The-Rest-of-Us
============================

A Mac OS X screensaver that displays album artwork from iTunes.

The year is 2006. iTunes 7 has just come out, introducing millions to the world of album artworks via Cover Flow. I downloaded my fair share of artwork (even though I do not have an iTunes account) and wanted a way to display them in a screensaver. I was running Mac OS X 10.3 Panther at the time, and couldn't use the screensaver that shipped with Tiger for this very purpose.

I wanted a screensaver very badly and since I couldn’t find anything out there, I had no option but to “get my hands dirty”. The result was Album Art For The Rest of Us version 1.0.

When I conceptualized I had imagined one artwork on the screen at a time, but somehow this (screenshot below) seems better. Preview:

Some of the “features” are:

- Displays an artwork on a random position on the screen.
- Adds an artwork every two seconds.
- Scales down “bigger” artworks to 300 X 300 pixels before displaying them. If the artwork isn’t “sqaure”, it scales - down the image such that the larger edge is 300 pixels.
- Uses 50% Transparency to display the images on top of each other.

Note: Since the screensaver uses Applescript to get the artwork, iTunes needs to be running in the background for it to function. If iTunes is not running when the screensaver starts, it will be started automatically.

Back in the day, I tested this on a machine running Mac OS X Panther 10.3.9 and later, Mac OS X Tiger, both alongside iTunes 7 on a PPC machine and it works fine.

Sharing this code in the rare case it might be useful for someone.
